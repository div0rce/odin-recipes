# odin-recipes

This is my first ever project and I'm glad that TOP is helping me!

I intend for this project to help me learn some of the HTML foundations so I can continue my journey in webdev.

# GOALS OF THIS PROJECT:

- Effective recipe website
- Eventually make it visually pleasing

# What I have learned:

I learned how to effectively create links. I also learned how to make an ordered list and an unordered list. I learned about paragraphs and headings. I will probably revisit this project.
